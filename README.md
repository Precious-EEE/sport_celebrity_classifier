## 🏅 Project Overview – Sport Celebrity Classifier Web App

The **Sport Celebrity Classifier** is an AI-powered web app designed to classify images of sports celebrities into predefined categories (e.g., footballers, basketball players, tennis stars, etc.). Built with deep learning and deployed through a clean and interactive web interface, the app allows users to upload images and receive real-time predictions of the athlete's category.

This project highlights the use of computer vision techniques, transfer learning, and web deployment — bringing together machine learning and intuitive UI design to create a smooth user experience.
